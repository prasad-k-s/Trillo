# Hotel Booking Website (Flexbox & SASS)

This is a simple hotel booking website created as part of my learning journey with CSS Flexbox and SASS. The project focuses on responsive design and smooth navigation animations. It is fully built using Flexbox to create a clean and flexible layout. The site is also responsive across various screen sizes using media queries.

## Features
- Fully responsive layout designed using CSS Flexbox
- Smooth vertical hover animation on the navigation menu
- Styled using SASS (CSS preprocessor)
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Desktop-first design
